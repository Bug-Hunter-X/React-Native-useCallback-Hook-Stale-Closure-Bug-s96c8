The solution is to include `count` as a dependency in the `useCallback` hook. This ensures that whenever `count` changes, a new memoized function is created.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Correct: uses functional update
  }, [count]); // Correct: count is now a dependency

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

Note the use of `prevCount => prevCount + 1` in the `setCount` function.  This functional update pattern is best practice when updating state based on its previous value, avoiding potential issues with asynchronous updates.
